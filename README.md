# Nexus - A Twitter-like Application built with Django
Nexus is a web application built using Django that replicates the core functionality of Twitter. It allows users to create an account, log in, log out, post tweets, and manage their tweets (create, edit, and delete). The application also includes user authentication functionality.

## Features
### 1. User Registration and Authentication:
* Users can create an account by providing a username, email, and password.
* Users can log in and log out of the application.
* User authentication is handled using Django's built-in authentication system.
2. Posting Tweets:
* Authenticated users can create new tweets and post them to the application.
* Each tweet is associated with the user who created it.
3. Managing Tweets:
* Authenticated users can view, edit, and delete their own tweets.
* Users can only edit or delete their own tweets, not those of other users.
